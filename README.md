Semantic HTML Project
ðŸ“– About the Project

This project focuses on building a solid foundation in Semantic HTML, while emphasizing:

Accessibility (using ARIA roles and attributes)

SEO optimization (via meta tags and structure)

Proper document structure with semantic elements

By completing this project, I have created a blog layout that is not only visually structured but also optimized for screen readers and search engines.
